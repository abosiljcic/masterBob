# masterBob

Master Bob is a platform for connecting users with contractors from various sectors. The main function of the application is to allow users to quickly and 
easily find qualified contractors in their vicinity, tailored to their individual needs. The application provides users with a simple experience for selecting the 
desired service, with the option to define the preferred date and time for the service. Through the contractor assignment algorithm, which analyzes expertise, 
availability, and the contractorâ€™s geographic location, users are matched with the contractor closest to their location. This approach ensures an improvement in 
service quality and simplifies the process of hiring contractors for various services. After each change in the user's request, an email notification is sent to both 
the user and the contractor, contributing to transparency and efficiency in communication, providing real-time information on any changes to the request.
