  <h2> Car inspection </h2>
  <p>
    Car inspection is a routine procedure that ensures your vehicle is safe, reliable, and compliant with legal standards. During an
    inspection, various aspects of the car are examined, including its engine performance, brake system, lights, tires, and emissions.
    This check-up helps identify any potential issues before they become serious problems, maintaining the car's efficiency and safety on
    the road. Regular inspections are crucial for preventing breakdowns and ensuring your vehicle meets the required safety and environmental
    regulations.
