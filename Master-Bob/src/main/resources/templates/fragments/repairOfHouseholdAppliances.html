  <h2> Repair of household appliances </h2>
  <p>
    Household appliances, or household products, encompass all the equipment intended for daily use at home. This includes items such as
    refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, electric kettles, irons, dryers, and microwaves. Purchasing household appliances, especially
    larger ones, often represents a significant investment. Naturally, we want these devices to last for many years. However, no device is
    indestructible, and eventually, they are likely to break down.
  </p>
  <h2> Repair household appliances cost </h2>
  <p>
    Diagnosing a fault typically costs between 11-23 EUR, depending on whether the equipment needs to be disassembled for inspection.
    The cost of repairing household appliances varies based on the type of fault. Minor issues, such as replacing a washing machine's drain
    hose or switch, cost around 7-10 EUR. Replacing a heating element in a washing machine costs about 12 EUR, while in a dishwasher, it
    costs around 28 EUR. The most expensive services include replacing bearings in a washing machine or refurbishing a module in a
    dishwasher, which cost approximately 70 EUR.
