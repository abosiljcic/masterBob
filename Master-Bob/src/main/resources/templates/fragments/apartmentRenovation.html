  <h2> Apartment renovation </h2>
  <p>
    Renovating an apartment, while often a long-anticipated and carefully planned endeavor, can present several challenges. The most common
    issues include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> A budget that rarely covers all desired improvements. </li>
    <li> Difficulty in finding a reliable renovation team. </li>
    <li> Space limitations, such as small or irregularly shaped rooms, or complications in obtaining permits for major changes. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Despite these hurdles, starting with thorough planning can help navigate the renovation process more smoothly.
  </p>

  <h2> Apartment renovation costs </h2>
  <p>
    Apartment renovation doesnâ€™t have to break the bank, but extensive projects can quickly drive up costs. What key factors influence the
    final expense?
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> <b> Scope of work </b> </li>
    <p>
      The extent of the renovation directly affects the cost. Since renovation services are typically priced per square meter, the total
      bill will increase with the area being renovated, whether it's painting, tiling, or flooring.
    </p>
    <li> <b> Professional fees </b> </li>
    <p>
      High-quality renovation teams come at a premium, but investing in experienced professionals is often worth it. This helps avoid
      costly future corrections and ensures a high standard of work.
    </p>
    <li> <b> Material choices </b> </li>
    <p>
      Premium construction and finishing materials can significantly raise costs. While top-tier products often promise better quality,
      they can be several times more expensive. A good renovation team can offer guidance on whether the extra cost is justified.
    </p>

    <li> <b> Additional services </b> </li>
    <p>
      Major modifications, such as installing partition walls or overhauling plumbing, are complex and costly. These significant changes
      can considerably increase the renovation bill.
    </p>
  </ul>
