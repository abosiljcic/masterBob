  <h2> Wallpapering </h2>
  <p>

    Wallpapers, which once adorned nearly every home and apartment, had been replaced by smooth, painted walls for many years. Today, they
    are making a strong comeback in a completely new form, becoming increasingly popular in interiors. These modern wallpapers are far more
    durable, often washable, easier to install, and most importantly, extremely fashionable compared to those of the past.
  </p>

  <h2> Why is it worth hiring a professional to wallpaper your walls? </h2>
  <p>
    Applying wallpaper requires more than just basic skills; it demands patience, precision, and the right tools. A thorough understanding
    of different types of wallpaper and adhesives is crucial, as using the wrong adhesive can compromise both the appearance and durability
    of the wallpaper. A skilled professional can offer valuable guidance on selecting the ideal wallpaper type and pattern for your space.
    They will advise on which wallpapers are suitable for various rooms and conditionsâ€”like vinyl wallpapers, which are durable and washable
    but can inhibit wall breathing, making them less suitable for every room. Professionals also excel at wall preparation, ensuring a smooth
    application that enhances the wallpaper's aesthetic and longevity. Their expertise is particularly beneficial for installing complex
    patterns or specialty wallpapers such as textile, vinyl, or fiberglass.
  </p>

  <h2> Wallpapering cost </h2>
  <p>
    Wallpaper prices vary widely, primarily depending on the complexity of the pattern. Designer wallpapers are usually the most expensive.
    Unlike some other materials, wallpapers are not typically sold by the square meter, except for larger photo wallpapers that come in
    puzzle-like pieces. They are generally available in rolls of 10 meters long and 75 centimeters wide. Regular wallpaper prices range from
    5 to 23 EUR, with some high-end options costing up to 75 EUR or more. You can either apply the wallpaper yourself or hire a professional.
    The cost for wallpaper installation ranges between 4 and 6 EUR per square meter.
